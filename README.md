# Place Name Generator

A very goofy application that generates ridiculous place names. Inspired by the hilarious place names around New South Wales, Australia.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12

## Usage

```console
$ python -m placenamegen
St Fairby
```

One name not enough to make you laugh? Easy!

```console
$ python -m placenamegen -n 10
Colongrabyne
Chittawayville Court
Saint Kempslands
Mount Palmcraftown
Brookby
Gladeland
Palona Hills
Galby
Mount Randtown
Saint Campsie
```

## Enjoy!

For a fun challenge, try testing your NSW knowledge by guessing which place names are real or not! (The application will generate real names every now and then.)
